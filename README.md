# Energy-Managment-Solution-2nd-Solution-
I developed a "Energy Managment System" Application using C#/.NET with Windows Form Application. The application is divided according to "N-Tier Architecture", which implements a MVC type of a behavior, We have Presentation Layer behaves as a View, Data Access Layer which is responsible for communicating with Database, A Business Access which works as a Controller and restrict the View to communication directly with a Database, and finaly Finally we have a Model Class which holds the property of our Database. The Presentation Layer (View) talk to the Business Layer(Controller) and Also to the Model, so we can assign values from View to our Model and assign those values further to Business Class (Controller). So..in this way....we are really restricting the Presentation Layer (View) to communicate Directly with our Database Layer...This is exactly what we call a "N-Tier Architecture"
